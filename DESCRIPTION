Description: Implements Generalized Binary Covariance Decomposition
    (GBCD) to dissect tumor transcriptional heterogeneity through analysis
    of multi-tumor single-cell RNA-sequencing data. The presence of strong
    inter-tumor heterogeneity often obscures patterns of transcriptional
    variations that are shared across tumors and may characterize
    clinically relevent molecular subtypes or cellular states. GBCD
    decomposes transcriptional heterogeneity into interpretable
    components, including patient-specific, dataset-specific and shared
    components relevant to disease etiology.
