Description: Implements Generalized Binary Covariance Decomposition (GBCD) to dissect 
             tumor transcriptional heterogeneity through analysis of multi-tumor 
             single-cell RNA-sequencing data. The presence of strong inter-tumor 
             heterogeneity often obscures patterns of transcriptional variations 
             that are shared across tumors and may characterize clinically relevent 
             molecular subtypes or cellular states. GBCD decomposes transcriptional 
             heterogeneity into interpretable components, including patient-specific, 
             dataset-specific and shared components relevant to disease etiology.
